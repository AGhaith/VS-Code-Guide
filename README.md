# VSCode Setup Guide

## What is an IDE vs. a Text Editor?

- **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**: A full software suite with built-in tools for coding, debugging, and compiling (e.g., PyCharm, Rider).
- **Text Editor**: A lightweight program for writing and editing code with fewer built-in tools (e.g., Notepad, VSCode).

## Why Use VSCode?

1. Lightweight and doesn‚Äôt use as much RAM as other IDEs.
2. Supports many programming languages: C, C++, C#, Java, Python, SQL, JavaScript, and more.
3. Tons of useful **extensions** for debugging, themes, and extra features.
4. FREE and works on Windows, Mac, and Linux, meaning you won‚Äôt need to adjust to a new tool if you switch platforms.

## Step 2: Setting Up VSCode

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Extensions

To use VSCode for any programming language, you will need its corresponding extension:

#### Language-Specific Extensions:

- **Python** (for Python development)
- **C/C++** (for C and C++ development)
- **Java Extension Pack** (for Java)
- **C# Dev Kit** (for C#)
- **SQL Server** (for SQL databases)

#### Quality-of-Life Extensions:

- **Prettier - Code Formatter** (for clean, formatted code)
- **Bracket Pair Colorizer** (makes nested brackets easier to read)
- **Code Spell Checker** (helps prevent typos in code)
- **Error Lens** (highlights errors inline)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Customize Your Theme

You can customize your VSCode theme and even download new themes from the Extensions tab (Ctrl+Shift+X).

- Go to **File ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Color Theme**
- Choose a theme you like (e.g., Dark+, Light+, or download one from the extensions).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Auto-Save

- Go to **File ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Settings**
- Search for **Auto Save** and enable it.

## Step 3: Writing Your First Code

### Understanding the Difference Between a File and a Folder

- A **file** is an individual document, like a Word document, a music file, or a program (e.g., Spotify, WhatsApp).
- A **folder** is a container that holds files and other folders.

üí° **Tip**: When writing code, always create a new file and place it in a suitable folder so you can easily find it later. You can organize folders by year, semester, or topic ‚Äî JUST DON'T LEAVE EVERYTHING ON YOUR DESKTOP OR IN RANDOM PLACES!!!!

### **Python Example**

Let‚Äôs assume you have installed the Python extension and are ready to write code.

1. Open VSCode and navigate to the folder where you want to create your file.
2. Click **New File** ‚Üí Name it anything you want, for example, `file.py`.
3. Then start writing your code, for example:
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
4. Save the file and run it in the terminal.

## Step 4: Understanding Basic Terminal Commands

To navigate and manage files through the terminal, you need to understand a few basic commands:

- **`cd <folder>`** ‚Äì Change directory (move into a folder).
- **`cd .`** ‚Äì Stays in the current directory (does nothing).
- **`cd ..`** ‚Äì Moves up one level to the parent directory.
- **`ls`** (List) ‚Äì Displays all files and folders in the current directory.
  - **`ls`** works on Windows if you use Git Bash or PowerShell.
  - On Command Prompt, use **`dir`** instead.

### ‚ö° Pro Tip: Open VSCode Instantly from the Terminal

Instead of manually opening VSCode and searching for your project, just navigate to your folder using `cd`, then type:

```sh
code .
```

This instantly launches VSCode in the current folder‚Äîno extra clicks needed. Try it and save yourself time!
